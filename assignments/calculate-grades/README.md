# Grade calculations

## Description

Make calculations using generators, list comprehensions, and loops.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* How to transform data structures.

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use list comprehensions and generators.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called calculate-grades containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * a module called `grade_calculator`
  * a suite of tests for your project

### Requirements  

* Passing unit tests
* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors
* No functions longer than 7 lines of code

## Normal Mode

Using this data:

```py
cohort1 = {
    'Avery': [63, 62, 41, 66, 84, 82, 73, 89, 69, 75],
    'Blake': [79, 97, 78, 78, 74, 69, 80, 100, 74, 70],
    'Casey': [93, 97, 99, 95, 98, 91, 96, 99, 100, 88],
    'Dakota': [71, 65, 72, 65, 24, 100, 84, 71, 59, 50],
    'Elliot': [84, 73, 90, 72, 69, 93, 61, 65, 81, 98],
    'Fox': [80, 91, 90, 80, 83, 73, 84, 89, 84, 84],
    'Gale': [41, 7, 64, 60, 78, 48, 73, 50, 69, 89]
}
```

Create functions that can take a data structure like `cohort1`.

* `student_means`: Return a new dictionary, with students as keys and their mean test score as the value.
  * Then add an optional argument, `drop_lowest`. When true, drop each student's lowest score before calculating their mean.
* `student_grades`: Return a new dictionary, with students as keys and their grade as the value. Add the optional `drop_lowest` argument like in `student_means`. A is 90+, B is 80-89, C is 70-79, D is 60-69, F is below 60.
* `all_scores`: Return a list of all the students' test scores.
* `class_mean`: Return a float, the mean score for the entire class across all tests.
* `score_histogram`: Return a new dictionary. Each key is a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). The value for each is all the students' test scores that fall within that grade range.


## Hard Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Normal Mode**:

* Use the `statistics` module to add `class_stdev`, which returns the standard deviation of the class' scores. Note that you have the entire population, so this should use `pstdev`.

## Notes

There is a hard requirement that no function have more than 7 lines of code. This will necessitate breaking up functions into other helper functions.
