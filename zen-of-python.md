**Beautiful is better than ugly.** I like to read code that is beautiful and easy; Python allows me to create an easy-to-read code.

**Explicit is better than implicit.** The code has to be perfectly explained.

**Simple is better than complex.** As Einstein once said: "If you can’t explain an idea to a 10 year old you don't understand the idea."

**Complex is better than complicated.** You can make complex code, but complicated code is difficult to maintain.

**Flat is better than nested.** This is self-explanatory.

**Sparse is better than dense.** Less code, better work.

**Readability counts.** Other people have to read your code and understand it. This is very important when the code is created by one person and maintained by others.

**Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.** Don’t break the rules. Please!

**Although practicality beats purity.** Only if it is an extreme case, one in which the rule is interrupting your work, can you break it.

**Errors should never pass silently.** Errors are like a disease: if they pass silently, they have more power. It is necessary to have a very good error detector.
